# Machine Learning
## Introduction
### What is machine learning?
* Grew out of work in AI
* New capability for computers
* Examples:
1. Database minning
2. Application cat't program by hand
3. Self-customizing programs
4. Understanding human learning(brain, real AI)
### Machine Learning definition
* Arthur Samuel(1959). Machine Learning: Feild of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* Tom Mitchell(1998). Well-posed Learning Problem: Acomputer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T as measured by P improveswith experience E.
### Machine learing algorithms:
* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Others: Reinforcement learning, recommender system
### Supervised learning
